# Olist-Marketing-Funnel
Personal project carried out where I make a report with Power BI analyzing the sales funnel process of the Brazilian marketplace Olist #Power BI
## 🪟 Overview

This project focuses on the Olist marketplace, a Brazilian platform that connects sellers with buyers, facilitating a wide range of commercial transactions. In this context, leads are potential sellers interested in listing and selling their products on Olist. 

The analyzed funnel is the process designed by Olist to convert these leads into active sellers, crucial for increasing the diversity of products available and thereby attracting more buyers to the platform. 

The funnel starts with the initial registration on a landing page and continues through a series of interactions aimed at validating and preparing the sellers to offer their products through Olist. This includes follow-up contacts and sales consultations until the culmination of their product listings on the marketplace.
